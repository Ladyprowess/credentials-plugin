-   All
    -   Canonical [reference documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/credentials-plugin/tree/master/docs) for plugin released.
	This documentation should be taken on a canonical basis, in other words, where behaviour deviates from the canonical documentation there is a bug.
	Sources such as <https://jenkins.io/doc/> and <https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/> are
        expected to use the canonical documentation as a basis for
        authoring original content that describes in a cohesive narative

    the user has create permission in any stores in scope, not just the
    root store ([JENKINS-41478](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41478))
-   Use the Jenkins.XSTREAM2 instance so that plugins can use alias to

### Version 2.1.2 (June 20, 2016)

-   If you added type restrictions you could not completely remove them
    ([JENKINS-36090](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36090))
-   The workaround for [JENKINS-26578](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26578) was
    breaking the unit tests for ssh-credentials (bug in htmlunit) so
    delay the "workaround" by 1ms so that htmlunit does not bomb out
    ([JENKINS-36034](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36034))

### Version 2.1.1 (June 15, 2016)

-   Add support to track where a credential is used ([JENKINS-20139](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20139)) - Note
    that tracking relies on credentials consumers recording the usage,
    so if there are issues with this please file issues **against the
    credential consuming plugin** as it is not a problem with the
    credentials API.
-   Create credentials through CLI ([JENKINS-28407](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28407))

### Version 2.1.0 (June 9, 2016)

-   Credentials store XML/JSON REST API cannot browse into domains
    ([JENKINS-24631](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-24631))
-   Added some extra NPE safety to try and prevent a NPE in plugins that
    do not use the API correctly ([JENKINS-35317](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35317))
-   System credentials store showing twice for credentials parameter Add
    button drop down when logged in as a user ([JENKINS-35488](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35488))
-   Credentials providers need to be able to list credentials without
    retrieving the backing secret ([JENKINS-35306](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35306)) -
    *this change changes the recommended way to populate drop down
    select boxes for plugin authors.* *The old way still works but is no
    longer recommended, hence the minor version bump.* An example of a
    new style implementation is as follows:

        public ListBoxModel doFillCredentialsIdItems(@AncestorInPath Job context, @QueryParameter String source, @QueryParameter String value) {
            if (context == null || !context.hasPermission(Item.CONFIGURE)) {
                // previously it was recommended to just return an empty ListBoxModel
                // now recommended to return a model with just the current value
                return new StandardUsernameListBoxModel().includeCurrentValue(value);
            }
            // previously it was recommended to use the withXXX methods providing the credentials instances directly
            // now recommended to populate the model using the includeXXX methods which call through to
            // CredentialsProvider.listCredentials and to ensure that the current value is always present using
            // includeCurrentValue
            return new StandardUsernameListBoxModel()
                    .includeEmptySelection()
                    .includeAs(Tasks.getAuthenticationOf(context), context, StandardUsernameCredentials.class,
                        URIRequirementBuilder.fromUri(source).build())
                    .includeCurrentValue(value);
        }

    The main changes in this sample are:

1.  \#\* Adding a QueryParameter for the current value. We can then
    ensure that the current value is always available by using the
    includeCurrentValue helper method
    -   Using includeAs to add the credentials using
        CredentialsProvider.listCredentials rather than the old pattern
        whereby the credentials would be retrieved directly and then
        converted into display name & id
    -   Now recommended to use Tasks.getAuthenticationOf(job) to get the
        authentication that the job will run as. When [JENKINS-35081](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35081) is
        resolved this will become more important

### Version 2.0.7 (May 27, 2016)

    ([JENKINS-35168](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35168))
-   Be more forgiving of users who have not configured their HTTPS
    front-end to forward the protocol details correctly ([JENKINS-35150](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35150))

### Version 2.0.6 (May 25, 2016)

-   The fix in 2.0.5 introduced a javascript error for configuring
    existing jobs that have already got the Add button. This has been
    fixed.

### Version 2.0.5 (May 24, 2016)

    works in newly created hetero lists again (was broken since 2.0)

### Version 2.0.4 (May 24, 2016)

-   Infinite loop in traversing the list of available credential stores
    for ComputerSet, Node, Computer context objects ([JENKINS-35075](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35075))

### Version 2.0.2 (May 24, 2016)

-   Follow-up for one remaining incorrect icon sizing when using a
    custom theme ([JENKINS-33191](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33191))

    Credentials/UseItem permission in cases where that permission was
    disabled and the Item/Configure permission should have been reported

### Version 2.0.1 (May 23, 2016)

-   Moved the Credential ID out of the advanced box
-   Where possible, the parameters view page of a build will present the
    credential parameter as a link to the credential to assist in
    disambiguation ([JENKINS-31991](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31991))
-   Impossible to scroll down the Add Credentials window content ([JENKINS-28864](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28864))
-   Users should be able to view their own credentials ([JENKINS-33872](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33872))
-   Incorrect icon sizing when using a custom theme ([JENKINS-33191](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33191))
-   Notify SaveableListener for global credentials updates ([JENKINS-33111](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33111))

### Version 2.0 (May 20, 2016)

    destination store
-   The Add modal dialog now supports selecting the credential domain to
    add into
-   The credentials management has been moved fully into the Credentials

    the credentials stores contributing to the current scope. All the
    links are now context menu links.
-   The Manage Jenkins » Configure Credentials screen has been reworked
    to actually allow for managing the credentials providers and types.
    It is now possible to restrict the credential types available per
    credential store as well as globally disable individual credential
    stores.

### Version 1.28 (Apr 30, 2016)

    credentials due to an empty password.

### Version 1.20 (Dec 19, 2014)

    retrofit and add credentials UI to plugins that use this for
    selecting a credential from a drop-down list (note there is a bug in
    this version that is fixed in 1.9.1 where it fails to correctly
    prepare data-binding)

### Version 1.8.3 (Sep 25, 2013)

### Version 1.8.2 (Sep 13, 2013)

-   Fixed [JENKINS-19575](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19575)

### Version 1.8.1 (Sep 12, 2013)

-   Fixed some minor layout issues.
-   There is a bug in core with lazy rendering which will affect the
    ability to configure the credential scope via the new UI. Suspect
